# certificate_generator


Introducing our Certificate Generator app, designed to simplify and streamline the process of creating personalized training certificates.

With this app, trainers can easily generate certificates for their trainees by inputting their data and capturing their fingerprints. The app also includes a waiting screen that shows the queue with details of the certificate creation process.

To ensure the accuracy and security of the certificate, our app requires a 2kT CEO fingerprint hardware scanner. This scanner captures the trainer's fingerprint, which is uniquely tied to their data and verifies their identity, guaranteeing that only authorized trainers can create certificates.

The app provides a user-friendly interface that guides trainers through the certificate creation process, making it quick and easy to produce professional-looking certificates. Additionally, our app now exports all the data to PDF certificate forms, allowing trainers to easily distribute the certificates to their trainees.

To ensure scalability and reliability, our Certificate Generator app is fully integrated with AWS backend, which provides a secure and scalable environment for storing and processing data. All data is encrypted and securely stored in AWS S3, ensuring the privacy of both trainers and trainees.

With our Certificate Generator app and the 2kT CEO fingerprint hardware scanner, you can trust that your certificates will be accurate, secure, and professional-looking. Try it out today and take your training program to the next level!
